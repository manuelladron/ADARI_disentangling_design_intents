# Multimodal Machine Learning: Cross-modal retrieval on ADARI dataset

Repo for the course 11-777 Multimodal Machine Learning, at Carnegie Mellon University. 

##Introduction
Design language is ambiguous; many terms and expressionsconvey the same idea, while many vastly different objectsare created with the same design intents. Despite advancesin multimodal research on captioning and retrieval tasks [1-7], subjective reasoning and description remain unresolved.Multimodal machine learning can describe an image of “agirl wearing a red shirt” but is unable to describe or generatea “minimal, elegant and sleek looking chair.” For compu-tational linguistics, resolving this recognized problem canchallenge the status of theoretical understanding, problem-solving methods and evaluation techniques [8].  For com-puter vision, this presents a complex challenge of disentan-gling qualitative attributes—sleek, elegant, minimal—fromimages. Beyond its relevance in pushing machine learningresearch boundaries, this would significantly impact creativepractice —designers, architects and engineers.  Real-timedesign intents understanding could open new design scenar-ios (e.g. voice-assisted natural language input), that reduceprocedures based on intent reinterpretation as imperativecommands —move, circle, radius, extrude, vertical— re-quired by digital design engines.

Our project gravitates around the Ambiguos Descriptionsand Art Images—ADARI—dataset. This dataset is a novelcollection of images and descriptions with special emphasison qualitative attributes present in design intents. The nov-elty of this project comes, therefore, from the study of suchsubjective qualitative attributes, and currently, we are testingwhether state-of-the-art multimodal approaches on retrieval,captioning or generation work on ADARI. We prove thatsuch current models, objective functions and evaluation met-rics are not efficient when dealing with intents, and that weare initiating an exploratory process to determine which taskwe will focus on for the remainder of the project. 

### ADARI Dataset 
To address the issue of disentangling design intents in thecontext of creative practice,  we use the Ambiguous De-scriptions and Art Images—ADARI—dataset.   The self-annotated ADARI dataset contains a total of 33,230 samplesof contemporary creative works represented by 264,028raw sentences—provided by the original creators and byart curators—that describe 241,982 images.  This datasetwas assembled by collecting articles that include editorialdescriptions along with associated images of the creativevisual work.  ADARI is an organized dataset divided intoseven categories: architecture, art, design, fashion, furniture,product design and technology. ADARI is the first datasetof pairs of images and descriptions that, besides containingobjective information of the elements in the images such aswooden chairorblack table, focuses on descriptions thatcorrespond to design intents, such asminimal, elegant andsleek looking chair. Table 1 shows the raw counts of sam-ples, images per domain, and sentences and adjectives fromcreatorsandcuratorsper domain. Table 2 shows that givena visual workpiece, original creators use a more ambiguouslanguage than curators in their descriptions, that it, normal-ized results of a human classification of ADARI labels intoqualitative or quantitative attributes.  Over 500 adjectivesper source (cretaor, curators and both) and per domain (fur-niture, fashion, wearable technology) have been annotated.Unsurprisingly, creators express their design intents whilecurators tend to describe the work objectively. Both sourcesof language are used as annotations for the labels of thedataset.

To simplify the complexity of the ADARI datset, and unlessotherwise stated, we use the ADARI Furniture domain inall  experiments.   This  contains  over  17,000  images  andapproximately a total of 60,000 adjectives.

### Research Challenges
Creative practice is a broad term that encompasses those fields that produce creative work. Specifically, in the contextof this project,  we refer as creative practice to any fieldthat relies on visual mediums and feedback in the creative process.  This includes works by designers, architects or engineers. In these domains, expressive language, used todescribe, review and discuss work, is crucial.  This type of language gravitates around design intents. For example,image a designer says to a colleague that they shoulddesignthe chair with a more dynamic look; the word <em>dynamic</em> conveys the design intent,  but it can be embodied in an intractable number of visual forms and design variations. While  design  intents  also  include  quantitative  attributes, such as colors, materials or dimensions, a great part of thevocabulary corresponds to qualitative traits.

The main technical challenge of this project is to disentanglesuch attributes from the design objects. For this, tasks suchas classification, retrieval or generation might require different objective functions and evaluation metrics. An important part of this project is to test such different techniques andcurrent models on ADARI, and gauge their effectiveness in disentangling intents.
